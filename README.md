# Movie Ticket Registration System

## Oblig 1 Summary

In Oblig 1, we developed the initial functionalities for our movie ticket registration system. Here's a summary of what we accomplished:

- Created an HTML layout for registering movie tickets.
- Implemented JavaScript to manage the addition and deletion of tickets.
- Provided basic input validation to ensure data integrity.

## Oblig 2 Summary

In Oblig 2, we expanded the system's capabilities and integrated it with a server. Here are the key enhancements we made:

- Moved ticket storage to a server using Spring Boot and Java.
- Stored ticket orders in an array on the server.
- Set up version control using a personal GitHub repository.

In Oblig 3
- Utilized the H2 "in-memory" database for simplicity.
- Sorted the list of ticket orders by last name when retrieving all orders, enhancing user experience.
- Maintained the same functionality as in Oblig 1 and 2.
- added edit ticket function
